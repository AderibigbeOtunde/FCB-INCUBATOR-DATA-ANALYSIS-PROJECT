Since the invention of computers, people have used the term data to refer to computer information, and this information was either transmitted or stored. But that is not the only data definition; there exist other types of data as well. So, what is the data?

is data” is that data is different types of information usually formatted in a particular manner. All software is divided into two major categories: programs and data. We already know what data is now, and programs are collections of instructions used to manipulate data.

We use data science to make it easier to work with data. Data science is defined as a field that combines knowledge of mathematics, programming skills, domain expertise, scientific methods, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract actionable knowledge and insights from both structured and unstructured data, then apply the knowledge gleaned from that data to a wide range of uses and domains.

So, now that we have a little better understanding of what data and data science are, let’s check out some interesting facts. But first, what do we mean by “information?” Let’s backtrack a little and look at the fundamentals.

Information is defined as classified or organized data that has some meaningful value for the user. Information is also the processed data used to make decisions and take action. Processed data must meet the following criteria for it to be of any significant use in decision-making:


## INTRODUCTION 

Growth in the field of technology, specifically in smartphones has led to text, video, and audio is included under data plus the web and log activity records as well. Most of this data is unstructured.

The term Big Data is used in the data definition to describe the data that is in the petabyte range or higher. Big Data is also described as 5Vs: variety, volume, value, veracity, and velocity. Nowadays, web-based eCommerce has spread vastly, business models based on Big Data have evolved, and they treat data as an asset itself. And there are many benefits of Big Data as well, such as reduced costs, enhanced efficiency, enhanced sales, etc.
